\description{
This package provides convenient software tools for causal path determinations
using Vinod (2014, 2015) and extends them. 
A matrix of asymmetric generalized correlations r*(x|y) is reported by the
functions \code{rstar} and \code{gmcmtx0}. The r*(x|y)
measures the  strength of the
dependence of x on y. If |r*(x|y)|> |r*(y|x)| it suggests that y is more likely
the "kernel cause" of x. This package refers to
the r* based criterion as  criterion 3 (Cr3) and further adds
two additional ways of comparing
two kernel regressions helping identify the `cause' called criterion 1 and 2
(Cr1 and Cr2) using absolute values of gradients and residuals, respectively.
See references below. The package has one-line commands summarizing all three criteria
leading to high (over 70 \%) success rates in causal path identifications.
}
\details{
The usual partial correlations are generalized for the asymmetric matrix of r*'s.
Partial correlations help asses the effect of x on y after removing the effect of a
set of (control) variables. See \code{parcor_ijk} and \code{parcor_ridg}.
Another way of generalizing partial correlations
by using incremental R-square values in kernel regressions are provided in functions
\code{mag_ctrl} and \code{someMagPairs}.

The package provides additional tools for causal assessment,
for printing the causal detections in a clear, comprehensive compact summary form,
such as \code{somePairs}, \code{some0Pairs}, \code{someCPairs}
for matrix algebra, such as 
\code{cofactor}, for outlier detection \code{get0outlier}, for numerical integration by the
trapezoidal rule, stochastic dominance \code{stochdom2} and \code{comp_portfo2}, etc.
The function \code{causeSummary} gives an overall summary of causal path results.
The compact function \code{silentPairs} gives one-line summary of causal path strengths,
where negative strength means that variable `causes' the variable in the first column.

The package has a function \code{pcause} for bootstrap-based statistical 
inference and another one 
for a heuristic t-test called \code{heurist}.  Pairwise deletion of missing data
is done in \code{napair}, while triplet-wise deletion is in \code{naTriplet}
intended for use when control variable(s) are also present. If one has
panel data, functions \code{PanelLag} and \code{Panel2Lag} are relevant.
\code{pillar3D} provides 3-dimensional plots of data which look
more like surfaces, than usual plots with vertical pins.

In simultaneous equation
models where endogeneity of regressors is feared, we suggest using 
Prof. Koopmans' method
which suggests ignoring endogeneity issues for all variables ``causing'' 
the dependent variable
assessed by our three criteria. Weighted summary of all three criteria is 
in \code{someCPairs}.

Recent 2020 additions include \code{canonRho} for generalized canonical 
correlations, \code{depMeas} to measure nonlinear dependence, and many 
functions for Granger causality between lagged time series including
\code{GcRsqX12}, \code{bootGcRsq} and \code{GcRsqYXc}.
