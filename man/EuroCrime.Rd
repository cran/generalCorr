\title{European Crime Data}
\description{
This data set refers to crime in European countries during 2008.
The sources are World Bank and Eurostat.  The crime statistics refers
to homicides. It avoids possible reporting bias from the presence
of police officers, because homicide reporting in most countries is
standardized.  Typical usage is: \code{data(EuroCrime);attach(EuroCrime)}.
The secondary source `quandl.com' was used for collecting these data.
