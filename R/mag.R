#' Approximate overall magnitudes of kernel regression partials dx/dy and dy/dx.
#'
#' Uses Vinod (2015) and runs kernel regression of x on y,  and also of y on x
#' by using the `np' package. The function goes on to compute a summary magnitude
#' of the overall approximate partial derivative dx/dy (and dy/dx), 
#' after adjusting for units by using
#' an appropriate  ratio of standard deviations.  Of course, 
#' the real partial derivatives of nonlinear functions
#' are generally  distinct for each observation.
#' 
#' @param x Vector of data on the dependent variable
#' @param y Vector of data on the regressor
#' @importFrom stats sd cor
#' @return vector of two magnitudes of kernel regression partials dx/dy and dy/dx.
#' @note This function is intended for use only after the direction of causal path
#' is already determined by various functions in this package (e.g. \code{somePairs}).
#' For example, if the researcher knows that x causes y, then only 
#' dy/dx denoted by dydx is relevant.
#' The other output of the function dxdy is to be ignored.
#' Similarly, only `dxdy' is relevant if y is known to be the cause of x.
