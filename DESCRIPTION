Description: Since causal paths from data are important for all sciences, the
     package provides sophisticated functions. The idea is simply 
     that if X causes Y (path: X to Y) then non-deterministic variation in X
     is more "original or independent" than similar variation in Y.  We compare 
     two flipped kernel regressions: X=f(Y, Z) and Y=g(X,Z), where Z are control 
     variables. Our first two criteria compare absolute gradients (Cr1) and 
     absolute residuals (Cr2), both quantified by stochastic dominance of four 
     orders (SD1 to SD4). Our third criterion (Cr3) expects X to be better able 
     to predict Y than the other way around using generalized partial correlation 
     If |r*(x|y)|> |r*(y|x)| it suggests that y is more likely
    the "kernel cause" of x. The usual partial correlations are generalized for 
    the asymmetric matrix of r*'s developed here.
    Partial correlations help asses effect of x on y after removing the effect of a
    set of variables. 
    The package provides additional tools for causal assessment,
    for printing the causal directions in a clear, comprehensive compact summary form,
    for matrix algebra, for "outlier detection", and for numerical integration by the
    trapezoidal rule, stochastic dominance, etc. 
    The package has functions for bootstrap-based statistical inference and one 
    for a heuristic t-test.
